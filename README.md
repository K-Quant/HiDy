 HiDy is a hierarchical, dynamic, robust, diverse, and large-scale financial benchmark KB that aims to provide various valuable financial knowledge as critical benchmarking data for fair model testing in different financial tasks. Specifically, HiDy currently contains 34 relation types, more than 493,000 relations, 17 entity types, and more than 51,000 entities. The scale of HiDy is steadily growing due to its continuous updates. To make HiDy easily accessible and retrieved, HiDy is organized in a well-formed financial hierarchy with four branches, *Macro*, *Meso*, *Micro*, and *Others*.

With HiDy, users can apply more in-depth, professional, logical, and interpreted knowledge to many common financial tasks, such as stock movement prediction (SMP), financial fraud detection (FFD), supply chain management (SCM), loan default risk prediction (LDRP) and financial event prediction (FEP). 




ðŸŽ‰ **NEWS**: 

- We have open-sourced the `Stock Movement Prediction and Backtesting Demo Website` equipped with HiDy's knowledge.
- We have open-sourced the `Pre-trained Extraction Models`.
- We have open-sourced the `Knowledge Extraction Implementation Repository`.
- We have published the 1.0 version of the hierachical dynamic financial knowlegde base `HiDy` in [Zenedo]().
